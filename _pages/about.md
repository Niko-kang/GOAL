I am a second-year masterâ€™s student in Physics with a focus on quantum information science, specializing in quantum precision measurement techniques . Concurrently, I am pursuing a research internship at the School of Computer Science, working on Embodied AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). My interdisciplinary training in CS abd Physics drives me to exploy the world with a strong interest in integrating physics principles into robotics, generative AI, and multimodal systems.
