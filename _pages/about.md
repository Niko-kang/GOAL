  I am a second-year master’s student in Physics with a focus on quantum information science, specializing in quantum precision measurement techniques. Concurrently, I am pursuing a research internship at the School of Computer Science, working on embodied AI and Large Models (LMs). My interdisciplinary training in CS and Physics drives me to explore the world with a strong interest in integrating physics principles into robotics, LMs，generative AI, and multimodal systems.
