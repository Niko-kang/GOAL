&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a second-year master’s student in Physics with a focus on <span style="color:red">quantum information science</span>, specializing in quantum precision measurement techniques. I received my bachelor's degree in <span style="color:red">Computer Science</span> from the School of Computer Science and Technology. Concurrently, I am pursuing a research internship at the School of Computer Science, working on <span style="color:red">embodied AI and Large Models (LMs)</span>. My interdisciplinary training in CS and Physics drives me to explore the world with a strong interest in integrating physics principles into robotics, LMs，generative AI, and multimodal systems.
