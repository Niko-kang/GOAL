Nature lover
======
I'd love to roam through nature â€” from soaring peaks to the deepest abysses, from drifting clouds to distant stars, from endless grassland pastures to the whispering seaside. Whenever I have a holiday, I enjoy going hiking or camping.

Music
======
I find great joy in the world of music, embracing genres such as electronic, jazz, and classical music. I began learning the piano at the age of five and later pursued training in singing, with a focus on national vocal music.

Sport
======
Every two weeks, I watch Formula 1 races. I also make time for weekly workouts and love riding road bikes during my free time.
